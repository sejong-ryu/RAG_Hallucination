{"context":"Comedy of intrigue  The comedy of intrigue, also known as the comedy of situation, is a genre of comedy in which dramatic action is prioritised over the development of character, complicated strategems and conspiracies drive the plot, and farcical humour and contrived or ridiculous dramatic situations are often employed.  Characterisation tends to be defined only vaguely and the plot gives the illusion of dynamic, constant movement.  The German philosopher Hegel argued that characters pursue their aims in such comedies via the use of deception.  The genre was first developed in the theatre of classical Rome by Plautus and Terence.  Examples of comedies of intrigue include Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's \"The Mandrake\" (1524), the anonymous Italian play \"The Deceived Ones\" (1531), Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice\" (c. 1596) and \"Much Ado About Nothing\", Thomas Heywood's \"The Wise Woman of Hoxton\" (c. 1604), Moli\u00e8re's \"Scapin the Schemer\" (1671), and the plays of Aphra Behn and Thomas D'Urfey. \n  Farce  In theatre, a farce is a comedy that aims at entertaining the audience through situations that are highly exaggerated, extravagant, and thus improbable.

{"context":"Pachinko  Pachinko (\u30d1\u30c1\u30f3\u30b3 ) is a type of mechanical game originating in Japan and is used as both a form of recreational arcade game and much more frequently as a gambling device, filling a Japanese gambling niche comparable to that of the slot machine in Western gaming.  A pachinko machine resembles a vertical pinball machine, but is different from Western pinball in several ways.  First, a pachinko machine uses small (11mm diameter) steel balls, which are rented to the player by the owner (usually a \"pachinko parlor,\" featuring many individual games in rows), while pinball games use a larger, captive ball.  The pachinko balls are not only the active object, but are also the bet and the prize.  The player loads one or more balls into the machine, then presses and releases a spring-loaded handle, which is attached to a padded hammer inside the machine, thus launching the ball into a metal track.  The track guides the ball around the edge of the playing field, then when the ball loses momentum, it falls into the playing field from near the top.  Some pachinko machines have a bumper to bounce the ball as it reaches the top, while other machines allow the ball to travel all the way around the field, to fall on the second time that it reaches the top. \n  Magical Halloween  Magical Halloween (\u30de\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3 , Majikaru Harowin ) , contracted as \"\u30de\u30b8\u30cf\u30ed \" for short, is a series of popular Pachinko games (slot machines) set in Halloween and developed by Konami, specifically its division KPE.

{"context":"Andrea Gail  F\/V Andrea Gail was a private fishing vessel that was lost at sea with all hands during the \"Perfect Storm\" of 1991.  The vessel and her six-man crew had been fishing the North Atlantic Ocean out of Gloucester, Massachusetts.  Her last reported position was 180 mi northeast of Sable Island on October 28, 1991.

The initial area of low pressure developed off Atlantic Canada on October 29.  Forced southward by a ridge to its north, it reached its peak intensity as a large and powerful cyclone.  The storm lashed the east coast of the United States with high waves and coastal flooding before turning to the southwest and weakening.  Moving over warmer waters, the system transitioned into a subtropical cyclone before becoming a tropical storm.  It executed a loop off the Mid-Atlantic states and turned toward the northeast.  On November 1 the system evolved into a full-fledged hurricane with peak winds of 75 miles per hour (120 km\/h), although the National Hurricane Center left it unnamed to avoid confusion amid media interest in the predecessor extratropical storm.  It later received the name \"the Perfect Storm\" (playing off the common expression) after a conversation between Boston National Weather Service forecaster Robert Case and author Sebastian Junger.  The system was the fourth hurricane and final tropical cyclone in the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season.

When \u015eahin Giray fled for his life from his rebellious subjects, and sought succor from his protectress Catherine II in St. Petersburg, Benjamin Aga followed him, hoping to collect the large sums of money that he had advanced to the fugitive.  Following the last partition of Poland in 1795, after Crimea had been under Russian rule for over a decade, Vilnius, Lutsk and Trakai came under Russian Rule.  Benjamin Aga, Solomon ben Nahamu Bobowitz, and the astronomer Isaac of Kalea, the son-in-law of Jacob Aga, who was the elder brother of Benjamin, went to St. Petersburg as a delegation from the Crimean Karaites, to petition the empress to release their sect from the double rate of taxation which all the Jews then had to pay.  Through the intervention of Count Nikolay Zubov, the delegation obtained from the empress the exemption from the \"Jewish\" taxes, some land grants, and other privileges which had not been asked for.  This established an important precedent for exempting the Karaites from subsequent anti-Jewish legislation.  The extraordinary success of the mission served to arouse great enthusiasm among the Karaites, and Aga and his fellow delegates were received with great honor on their return.

{"context":"Chartism  Chartism was a working-class movement for political reform in Britain that existed from 1838 to 1857.  It took its name from the People's Charter of 1838 and was a national protest movement, with particular strongholds of support in Northern England, the East Midlands, the Staffordshire Potteries, the Black Country, and the South Wales Valleys.  Support for the movement was at its highest in 1839, 1842, and 1848, when petitions signed by millions of working people were presented to the House of Commons.  The strategy employed was to use the scale of support which these petitions and the accompanying mass meetings demonstrated to put pressure on politicians to concede manhood suffrage.  Chartism thus relied on constitutional methods to secure its aims, though there were some who became involved in insurrectionary activities, notably in south Wales and in Yorkshire. \n  Zephaniah Williams  Zephaniah Williams (1795 \u2013 8 May 1874) was a Welsh coal miner and Chartist campaigner, who was one of the leaders of the Newport Rising of 1839.

Today, bikinis appear in competitions, films, magazines, music, literature, magazines and even video games.  Despite the easy availability of more revealing glamour imagery, bikini modeling remains popular and can still create controversy.  Portrayals of the bikini in popular culture led, to a large extent, to its acceptance by Western society at large.  In 1960, Brian Hyland's pop song \"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\" inspired a bikini-buying spree.  The white bikini worn by Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder in the 1962 James Bond film \"Dr. No\" has been cited as one of the most famous bikinis of all time and an iconic moment in cinematic and fashion history.  By 1963, the movie \"Beach Party\", starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon, led a wave of films that made the bikini a pop-culture symbol. \" Playboy\" first featured a bikini on its cover in 1962.  The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue debuted two years later.  This increasing popularity was reinforced by its appearance in contemporary movies like \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini\" featuring Annette Funicello and \"One Million Years B.C.\" (1966) featuring Raquel Welch.  Raquel Welch's fur bikini in \"One Million Years B.C.\" gave the world the most iconic bikini shot of all time in that period and the poster image became an important iconic moment in cinema history.
