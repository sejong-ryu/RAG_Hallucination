Although it was never a large motion picture producer, Orion achieved a comparatively high reputation for Hollywood quality.  Woody Allen, James Cameron, Jonathan Demme, Oliver Stone, and several other prominent directors worked with Orion during its most successful years from 1978 to 1992.  Of the films distributed by Orion, four won Academy Awards for Best Picture: \"Amadeus\" (1984), \"Platoon\" (1986), \"Dances with Wolves\" (1990), and \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991).  Two other Orion films, \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" (1986) and \"Mississippi Burning\" (1988), were nominated for that same category.
